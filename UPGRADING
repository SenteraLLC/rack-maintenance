******** Rack::Maintenance 2.0.0 *********

Rack::Maintenance 2.0.0 has dropped the built-in filter for /assets.
This means that all your paths will now be blocked in maintenance
mode, unless you exclude them in the configuration.

To bring back pre-2.0.0 behaviour, configure the gem like so:

config.middleware.use 'Rack::Maintenance',
  file: Rails.root.join("public", "maintenance.html"),
  without: /\A\/assets/
